    "### House Price Prediction Using Ensemble Learning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### AIM :\n",
    "To implement and evaluate the performance of LightGBM, an ensemble learning technique, in predicting house prices using the Ames Housing Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Github Repo:\n",

    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n",
    "The paper explores the application of ensemble learning techniques, particularly LightGBM, in the domain of house price prediction. It provides insights into the methodology, experimental setup, and results obtained from applying LightGBM to the Ames Housing Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
    "The primary objective is to develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "The housing market is characterized by complex interactions between numerous factors that influence property prices. Traditional regression models often struggle to capture these intricate relationships, leading to suboptimal predictions. Ensemble learning techniques, such as LightGBM, offer a promising alternative by leveraging the collective wisdom of multiple models to improve predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### SOLUTION:\n",
    "LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, has gained popularity in recent years due to its efficiency, scalability, and superior performance in handling large datasets. By employing a tree-based approach, LightGBM can effectively capture nonlinear relationships and interactions among features, making it well-suited for complex prediction tasks like house price estimation.\n",
